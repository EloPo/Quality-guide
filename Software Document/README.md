What is Documentation Testing?

Documentation Testing involves testing of the documented artifacts that are usually developed before or during the testing of Software.

Documentation for Software testing helps in estimating the testing effort required, test coverage, requirement tracking/tracing, etc. This section includes the description of some commonly used documented artifacts related to Software development and testing, such as:

<ul><li>Test Plan</li><li>Requirements</li><li>Test Cases</li><li>Traceability Matrix</li></ul>
